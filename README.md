# Typescript + React + Mobx
My take on a starter for Typescript + React + Mobx. Trying to only include the default set of things I usually start with. 

 - **Typescript!** Types! Interfaces! Decorators! Async/Await! 
 - **React!** Declarative UI!
 - **React-Router!** HTML5 history! Use the back button! Have routes!
 - **Mobx!** State management! Store injection!
 - **Webpack 4!** Build it all! 
 - **Semantic UI!** Prettier UI!
 - **Hot Reload!** Speed up that inner loop! Save = compile + refresh!

## Getting Started 

Run these commands in the root of the repo. 

```sh
npm install 
npm run start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/

## vscode 
If you want to use this project with Visual Studio Code, make sure you install the "[Debugger for Chrome](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug)" extension; the "F5" to launch an attached chrome instance with source maps! 

Make sure webpack-dev-server is already running, either through the "webpack-dev-server" vscode task, or just from running `npm start`
